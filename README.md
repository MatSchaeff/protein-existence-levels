Simple example that shows how to use nextprot community viewers.

accessible in nextprot throught the following link: https://search.nextprot.org/entry/NX_P01308/gh/ddtxra/protein-existence-levels

To create community viewers:

* Create a new repository on GitHub
* Create a branch gh-pages
* Create your website structure, requires at least one index.html at the root of the folder
* Test it locally

To publish your viewer in nextprot you can either:
